/*
  This web application helps a user calculate a GPA for their courses.

  User enters a name and grade for each course via a form. We build a list of these courses,
  and print the list to the page every time list changes (on form submit).

  When user clicks the "calculate" button, we get the average of the grades for each
  course in the list, and print it to the page.

  When user clicks "clear" button, the list of courses is emptied.
  The page is updated to remove the old list and any previously calculated GPA.

  Comments labeled TODO and BUGFIX must be done for the application to work properly.
  REVIEW comments are requests for you to use your judgement to optimize the code.
